# Module_end_project_Python_EE_DSML
This module end python programming project of Entri-Elevate DSML program is submitted by Navaneeth Krishnan S of Batch B1-ADV

Based on the given dataset of employees working in ABC company, this module end project tries to provide a detailed explanation, report and answers to questions regarding employees in each team using python programming language. The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The analysis report is completed and attached as a ‘Jupyter-notebook’ file.

I performed data pre-processing directly in Excel for the dataset of employees working in ABC company. By using the concepts of numpy and pandas, matplotlib and seaborn in python programming, I identified how many players/employees are there in each team and their percentage splitting with respect to total employees. I segregated employees w.r.t different positions and found from which age group most of the employees belong to. Also, I added visualizations for the above three questions. Then found out under which team and position spending in terms of salary is high. And finally, I represented visually and found if there is any correlation between age and salary.

Completing this project by performing data preprocessing and data analysis gave valuable insights regarding team distribution, position segregation, age group distribution, player positions, high spending teams and the correlation of age and salary. These findings done in this project can help the ABC company in many ways such as better decision-making, resource allocation, delivering relevant products and services, understanding characteristics of employees and improved operational efficiency of the team.
